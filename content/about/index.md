I’m Xiaocao You, a junior majoring in Statistics at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics.My studies have sparked a interest in the realms of biomedical research and statistics.I acknowledge that my current knowledge is not extensive, so I maintain an open-minded attitude towards exploring directions in other fields.

I thoroughly enjoy articulating my insights, whether through written explanations or face-to-face communication. Currently, I’ve delved into providing a comprehensive overview of the Mixture Cure Model. Additionally, I’m engaged in research on survival analysis, though progressing at a fairly slow pace.

If you have any interests to communicate with me, you can email me at [at].
