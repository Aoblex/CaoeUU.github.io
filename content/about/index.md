![School of Statistics and Management](/images/School-Stat.jpg)

I’m ***Xiaocao You***, a junior majoring in Statistics at ***[Shanghai University of Finance and Economics](https://english.sufe.edu.cn/)***. My studies have sparked a interest in the realms of biomedical research and statistics. Also, I harbor great curiosity towards modeling financial phenomena. I acknowledge that my current knowledge is not extensive, so I maintain an open-minded attitude towards exploring directions in other fields.

I thoroughly enjoy articulating my insights, whether through written explanations or face-to-face communication. Currently, I’ve delved into providing a comprehensive overview of the Mixture Cure Model. 

For those who share similar interests or simply want to connect, feel free to drop me an email at ***<xiaocao.you@stu.sufe.edu.cn>***. I'm always open to meaningful conversations and collaborations.
