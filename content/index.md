Welcome to my land!

This is a space dedicated to documenting my learning journey and the insights gained along the way.Continuous updates will reflect my ongoing progress. Below, you'll find my personal introduction and details about the website.

## Introduction

I'm Xiaocao You, a junior majoring in Statistics at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics.My studies have sparked a interest in the realms of biomedical research and statistics.I acknowledge that my current knowledge is not extensive, so I maintain an open-minded attitude towards exploring directions in other fields.

I thoroughly enjoy articulating my insights, whether through written explanations or face-to-face communication. Currently, I've delved into providing a comprehensive overview of the Mixture Cure Model. Additionally, I'm engaged in research on survival analysis, progressing at a fairly slow pace.

If you have any interests to communicate with me, you can email me at [at].
